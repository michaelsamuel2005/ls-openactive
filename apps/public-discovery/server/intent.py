"""C-08 deterministic intent parser (WP §9).

AI-ASSISTED SCAFFOLD. NOT authorship evidence. The conversational layer may interpret and communicate;
it does NOT decide what is true (WP §9.1). This parser is deterministic and closed-vocabulary: it
never guesses — an unrecognised or incomplete query routes to parse_clarification, never to a
fabricated result. An LLM parser can later replace this behind the same typed-intent contract
(constrained decoding), but the discipline demonstrated here does not depend on a model.
