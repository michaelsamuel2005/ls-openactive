## Claims → controls → evidence → maturity

### CL-1 — Public and staff surfaces never disagree on the retained decision, and restricted staff values cannot change public output.
*Permitted wording:* evidence-symmetric but authority-asymmetric applications with value-level non-interference
- **Affected / harm:** public users and London Sport staff — leaked staff information, or public/staff disagreement that misleads a decision
- **Controls:** K-noninterference (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-contracts ✅, T-staffslice ✅, T-publicslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** evidence semantics + transport — pending
- **Authority:** public_safe_demonstration gate — pending
- **Residual risk:** person-level review of projections outstanding
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-2 — Missing or unknown evidence is never rendered as a negative fact.
*Permitted wording:* unknown is rendered as 'not published', never as 'no' or 'free'
- **Affected / harm:** public users — user misled into believing an activity is unavailable/free when the data is simply silent
- **Controls:** K-nocollapse (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-wording ✅, T-contracts ✅, T-publicslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** content / HCI — pending
- **Authority:** content sign-off — pending
- **Residual risk:** wording to be corrected in Clarence's own words + reviewed
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-3 — No unsupported factual token reaches a user.
*Permitted wording:* verify-before-render; only verified claims are rendered
- **Affected / harm:** public users — a fluent but unsupported statement is believed
- **Controls:** K-verify (Clarence + Michael)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-contracts ✅, T-checker ✅
- **Reviewer:** evidence semantics (Section 09) — pending
- **Authority:** Section 09 vocabulary ratification — pending
- **Residual risk:** conversational renderer not yet built
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-4 — The interface preserves the certified slate and order; client controls cannot bypass abstention.
*Permitted wording:* map/list/sort preserve the certified slate and order
- **Affected / harm:** public users — a re-ordered or padded list presents a non-certified result as certified
- **Controls:** K-order (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-contracts ✅, T-ia ✅, T-publicslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** HCI / evaluation parity — pending
- **Authority:** public_safe_demonstration gate — pending
- **Residual risk:** none known within tested routes
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-5 — Restricted staff information cannot leak to the public plane; staff access is role-gated.
*Permitted wording:* one-way disclosure; role-appropriate presentation
- **Affected / harm:** publishers, staff, public users — receipts/lineage/aggregates or research identity exposed publicly
- **Controls:** K-disclosure (Clarence + Wesley)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-contracts ✅, T-staffslice ✅, T-publicslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** security / IAM — pending
- **Authority:** security review + RATIFY-15-06 — pending
- **Residual risk:** real IAM/break-glass is Wesley's; role gate here is a stub
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-6 — Forged, stale, swapped or illegally escalated evidence is rejected by an independent checker.
*Permitted wording:* limited technical independence certificate checker
- **Affected / harm:** public users, London Sport — a wrong production decision is trusted
- **Controls:** K-checker (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-checker ✅
- **Reviewer:** non-author code review + Section 09 contract — pending
- **Authority:** RATIFY-09-04 — pending
- **Residual risk:** production/reference/checker discrepancy register empty until production emits certificates
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-7 — Application effects are not confounded with retrieval, ranking or content differences.
*Permitted wording:* shared-backend P0/P1/P2 and W0/W1/W1-NA conditions
- **Affected / harm:** the evaluation / research claim — an interface effect is falsely attributed, invalidating a headline result
- **Controls:** K-conditions (Clarence (build); Fahmi (estimands))
- **Evidence (tests):** T-conditions ✅
- **Reviewer:** evaluation design (Fahmi) — pending
- **Authority:** RATIFY-14-07/08 + ethics route — pending
- **Residual risk:** human-effect claims require ethics approval
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-8 — Governed actions cannot skip independent review or approval, and sending requires an authorised role.
*Permitted wording:* action-card workflow with separated review/approval/send

- **Evidence (tests):** T-actioncard ✅, T-staffslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** Section 18 partner route — pending
- **Authority:** Section 18 owner — pending

### CL-9 — All pre-code reconciliation blockers are dispositioned with owner, tests and fallback.
*Permitted wording:* reconciliation register per WP §3
- **Affected / harm:** the team / examiner — a release-blocking ambiguity is hidden beneath an implementation choice
- **Controls:** K-register (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-register ✅
- **Reviewer:** team ratification — pending
- **Authority:** team ratification (RATIFY-19-04) — pending
- **Residual risk:** institutional cells remain PENDING until ratified
- **Maturity verdict:** BLOCKED  — blocked on: non-author review pending; authority decision pending

### CL-10 — The applications are evaluated toward WCAG 2.2 AA within a stated, tested matrix (not a blanket conformance claim).
*Permitted wording:* evaluated toward WCAG 2.2 AA within the tested matrix
- **Affected / harm:** disabled users — an accessibility barrier prevents a tested route for material users
- **Controls:** K-a11y (Clarence)
- **Evidence (tests):** T-publicslice ✅, T-staffslice ✅
- **Reviewer:** non-author HCI/accessibility reviewer (C-BLOCK-03) — pending
