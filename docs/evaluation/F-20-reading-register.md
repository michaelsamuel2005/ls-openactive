# F-20 — Reading Register (evaluation stream)

**Owner:** Fahmi Alshahabi · Created 14 August 2026 · Updated 18 August 2026 · v1.1
**Status:** ACTIVE. This register supersedes the §20 reading list of `FAHMI_ALSHAHABI_SPECIALISED_WORK_PACKAGE.md` for the evaluation stream.
**Why it exists:** the work package is no longer available to its owner and no copy could be obtained. Rather than reconstruct a list from memory — which would produce plausible but unverifiable citations, the failure mode CA-01.A11 exists to prevent — this register is derived from the opposite direction: **from the committed artifacts in this repository and the claims they actually make.** Every row therefore traces to a file and a claim that exists and can be checked, not to a remembered document.
**Rule (CA-01.A11):** no source is attested until it binds to a version of record with DOI, personally read, with the reader's own claim and limit wording. A surname alone is not a citation.
**Companion:** `docs/evaluation/source-reading-matrix.md` holds the completed attestations.

## 2. Required next — each gates a claim already committed

| # | Source | Claim in the repo that requires it | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-12 | Dror, Baumer, Shlomov & Reichart (2018), *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Testing Statistical Significance in NLP*, ACL. **Verify VoR + DOI before attesting.** | F-06 sizing and the SAP's choice of test and multiplicity handling across benchmark arms. | **High — gates F-06** |
| R-13 | Geifman & El-Yaniv (2017), *Selective classification for deep neural networks*, NeurIPS. **Verify VoR + DOI.** | The abstention/coverage framing behind `U`, `Q` and the risk–coverage reporting in F-08. | **High — gates F-08 fallback** |
| R-14 | Gelman — **which paper is undecided.** Candidates: (2006) variance priors, *Bayesian Analysis* 1(3); (2008) weakly informative separation priors, *Ann. Appl. Stat.* 2(4). | F-10 prior choices. Cannot be attested as "Gelman" — CA-01.A11 requires a specific version of record. | Medium — gated on F-10 scope |

**Deferred, dated 18 August 2026 — not yet load-bearing.** No committed artifact currently makes a
claim that depends on these, so under §6 they do not gate a freeze: Bowman & Dahl; Raji et al.;
Cook, Gelman & Rubin; Modrák et al.; Gardner et al.; Ribeiro et al.; Selbst et al. Revisit if F-10
survives at full scope or if the fairness/robustness suites are executed.

## 3. Conditional — required only if the Bayesian secondary survives at full scope

Deferred pending the ratification decision on analysis primacy (CA-01.A8) and F-10's scope. If the hierarchical layer narrows to fewer outcome families or is reported estimatively, these are not needed.

| # | Source | Would support |
|---|---|---|
| R-09 | Gelman (2006), prior distributions for variance parameters, *Bayesian Analysis* 1(3) | Prior choices in F-10 |
| R-10 | Gabry, Simpson, Vehtari, Betancourt & Gelman (2019), *JRSS A* 182(2) | Bayesian workflow and predictive checks in F-10 |
| R-11 | Cook, Gelman & Rubin (2006), *JCGS* 15(3) | Simulation-based calibration of the F-10 implementation |

## 4. Unresolved inherited citations

| Entry | Problem | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| "Angelopoulos 2025" | Does not resolve. The Gentle Introduction is 2023; Conformal Risk Control is ICLR 2024; Learn then Test appears to remain a preprint; *Theoretical foundations of conformal prediction* (arXiv:2411.11824, 2025) is a pre-publication book draft. None is both 2025 and peer-reviewed in a form our rules accept. | **CLOSED 18 August 2026 — formally declared unresolvable.** No candidate binds to a 2025 version of record meeting CA-01.A11. The entry is withdrawn rather than repaired; R-05 (Angelopoulos & Bates 2023, Appendix A) covers the LTT material the claim actually needed. Any future use of "Angelopoulos 2025" in project documents should be treated as a citation defect. |

## 5. Open governance issue

**Updated 18 August 2026: the work package has been recovered.** It exists outside this repository and remains outside it. Under the team's founding rule — a protocol that exists only outside the repository does not exist — any load-bearing content still needed from it must be re-committed to the repo by its custodian, or superseded by artifacts that are in the repo. This register supersedes its §20 list for the evaluation stream; the phase plan, viva/defence bank (§21) and ownership statement (§25) remain outstanding and should be re-issued into `docs/` or re-authored.

## 6. Working rule

A source enters section 2 only when a committed artifact makes a claim that depends on it. Sources are not read because they appear on a list; lists are derived from claims. Where no committed claim depends on a source, it does not gate a freeze.

*Change log: v1.0 — 14 Aug 2026, created from committed repo artifacts after loss of the work package §20 list. v1.1 — 18 Aug 2026: R-06/R-07/R-08 moved to attested; Angelopoulos 2025 closed as unresolvable; next-required set replaced with R-12/R-13/R-14; seven sources deferred as not-yet-load-bearing; work package recovery recorded.*
